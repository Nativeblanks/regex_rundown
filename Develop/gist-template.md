# Regex Rundown

Welcome to the Regex Rundown. A complete reference guide.

## Summary

Regex is a great way of performing a very specific search or setting requirement criteria 

Let us use and email as an example. 
The following line can be used to used to set requirements for a valid email.
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

Take a look at the example email below.
Example@regex.com

If we section this off it starts to look similiar
(Example)@(regex).(com) is starting to look closer to the line we see above but what does it mean?
everything within the () may be different however we want the @ and the . to be exactly the same.

The first part of the email before the @ symbol is defined in ([a-z0-9_\.-]+) which matches any lowercase letter or digit 0-9 or underscores.

The @ symbol is a required for a valid email.

After the @ we have ([\da-z\.-]+) which matches one or more digits, letters, periods and hypens.

The . is also required so nothing will take its place.

After the period it requires any lowercase letter between 2 and 6 characters([a-z\.]{2,6})$

## Regex Components

### Anchors
- ^ the caret anchor matches the beginning of the text.
- $ the dollar anchor matches the end of the text.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers match a number of instances of a character, group, or character class in a string.

Exact {n} \d{4} - match four digits  
Range {n, m} \d{2,4}/g - match two, three, or four digits

### OR Operator

The symbol | is used to indicate OR 

I like (dogs|penguins)

It would match a string like "I like dogs" OR "I like penguins",
but not "I like cats" and not "I like dogs or pengiuins" 

### Character Classes

A character class allows you to match any symbol from a certain character set. A character class is also called a character set. Suppose that you have a phone number like this:

+1-(336)-123-5566
And you want to turn it into a plain number:

13361235566

let phone = '+1-(336)-123-5566';  
let re = /\d/g;

let numbers = phone.match(re);  
let phoneNo = numbers.join('');

console.log(phoneNo);

### Flags
Flags allow you to define where you are seaching for the information.
g allows a global search
i is a case-insensitive search
s allows . to match a newline characters

### Grouping and Capturing

Grouping is assigned by parentheses, it unifies a pattern or string to be matched in a complete block.

### Bracket Expressions

[a-z0-9_\.-] a-z indicates we are looking for lowercase a through z, 0-9 indicates we are looking for 0 through 9, and we literal match special characters "_" underscore, "\." dot, and "-" hyphen.  
[\da-z\.-] indicates we are looking for "\d" 0 through 9, "a-z" a through z, "\." dot, and "-" hyphen.  
[a-z\.] indicates we are looking for "a-z" a through z, and "\." dot.

### Greedy and Lazy Match

Greedy search
To find a match, regex uses the following pattern:

For every position in the string
Try to match the pattern at that position.
If thereâ€™s no match, go to the next position.

This can cause long matches like
the "dog" chased the "cat"
with an expression like  ".+"
the result would find the first and last ""
Resulting in the string = "dog" chased the "cat"

Lazy Match 
Uses a ? in order to indicate it will use the shortest possible result that matches
Using the previous example if we use  ".+?"
This would result in "dog" "cat"

### Boundaries

The \b is an anchor. The following three positions qualify as boundaries:  
1. Before the last character in a string if the first character is a word character.
2. After the last character in a string if the last character is a word character.
3. Between two characters in a string if one is a word character and the other is not.

### Back-references

Back-references allow you to match a pair of opening and closing tags.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind

These allow you to use the first and last line.
